Robert Laird Stewart, D.D. (b. 1840 – d. 1916) operated throughout his life at the nexus of several colonizing missions. While I encountered him through my research on the teaching of the ancient past through the lens of Biblical Antiquities/Archaeology at Lincoln University, Stewart’s life extended far beyond Pennsylvania. Stewart was a war veteran who fought with Pennsylvania’s 141st Regiment in the Civil War. He traveled west to engage in the ministry of frontier towns during the Colorado gold boom of the 1870s. He ministered at Mahoning Presbyterian Church in central Pennsylvania. By 1896 he assumed a professorship at Lincoln, both teaching Biblical Antiquities and acting as Dean of the Faculty. During this time, he traveled to “the Holy Land” to research the excavations of various Biblical sites and published two works on the subject that were then used to instruct students and laypeople alike. While engaging in these pursuits, Stewart also worked on multiple volumes pertaining to the life of Sheldon Jackson, a lifelong friend from Princeton and a notorious actor in the colonization of the Alaska and Colorado territories. At the time of his death in 1916 Alhambra, California, Stewart had published one monograph on his Civil War regiment, two monographs on the lands of the Bible and their archaeological and architectural remains, and one monograph and two major articles on Sheldon Jackson and the pioneering mission of the Presbyterian church in the Western territories. He had also preached extensively on the value of missionary work at his own church and others while traveling.","Harmonic Closeness Centrality":"0.6829710144927538","Weighted Degree":"36.0","title":"Robert Laird Stewart","Weighted Out-Degree":"36.0","Out-Degree":"36","In-Degree":"0","Closeness Centrality":"0.5935483870967742","Hub":"0.560807","Component ID":"0","Eigenvector Centrality":"1.0","Clustering Coefficient":"0.023809523809523808","Betweenness Centrality":"2700.4142857142847","Number of triangles":"15"},"color":"rgb(95,198,19)","size":20.0},{"label":"Sarah Ewing Stewart Endowment Fund","x":-282.8498840332031,"y":-169.3970947265625,"id":"28","attributes":{"Modularity Class":"2","Eccentricity":"5.0","Degree":"1","Authority":"0.016658735","Weighted In-Degree":"1.0","PageRank":"0.004777412472108788","description":"Trust established at R.L.

Part of this came from the fact that I did not expect to see their presence included in the text and was expecting more to come from Land of Israel. The first place this commentary appears in Jackson’s work is in an excerpt on Jackson’s work written by Rev. Dr. R.B. Abbott that Stewart deems “necessary for its transference to these pages as a whole”.[1] Abbott is setting up the cities of La Crosse and La Crescent in opposition to each other, both in their historical framework and their corresponding religious symbols. His writing, quoted by Stewart, states that in the “prospective city of La Crescent—the symbol of Islam—Sheldon Jackson began”.[2] This insertion is interesting in its seeming irrelevance to the rest of the work. However, it potentially indicates networks of thought that placed Islam in opposition to Christian values and theology. More directly pertinent is Stewart’s invocation of Islam in his chapter on Mormonism. While he states that Muslims are closer to Christians than Mormons, he quotes a passage from Wm. Hepworth Dixon indicating that this is not so much an elevation of Islam as part of a larger smear against Mormonism.[3] In the quote Dixon goes on to claim that the Mormon god is closer to “Roman Jove”, further illustrating this divide.[4] The following passage in Stewart’s own words establishes links between Islam (or, more accurately, a construction of the “Orient” that involves Islamic peoples) and Mormonism. Stewart compares Brigham Young as rivaling “the sultans of the East in his assumption of arbitrary power, and in the number of his wives and concubines”.[5] He then quotes an unidentified source saying that Young journeyed “like an Oriental prince, with two personal servants, a barber, and one of his wives and was followed by a procession of carriages and men on horseback”.[6] The invocation of these stereotypes is not atypical for the period—rather, the motif of the Mormon as Muslim, and therefore a deviant “other”, was prevalent in the time of Jackson’s missionary work.[7] However, there are some aspects of Stewart’s life that make me take pause and consider why this rhetorical framing merits further dissection. In Tammy Heise’s 2013 article “Marking Mormon Difference: How Western Perceptions of Islam Defined the ‘Mormon Menace’” she provides a historiography and critique of the scholarship on Muslim-Mormon comparisons. Two significant aspects of her assessment struck me as contrary to what I am seeing from Stewart. The less pressing one is that she identifies the public vitriol towards Mormons and their comparison to Muslims as receding after Smoot’s election to the Senate, replaced by mainstream views of their presence as “a curiosity or a competitor instead of a real danger”.[8] Given that Stewart’s work on Jackson was published in 1908 and likely started well in advance, and that Smoot’s confirmation to the Senate was of significant upset to Stewart in the work, I am not entirely surprised that this rhetoric was deployed past the timeline of most mainstream media in Heise’s assessment.[9] However, I am keeping note of it to consider how Stewart’s ideology may have persisted in certain circles beyond what is currently discussed in the scholarship.","source":"37","target":"82","id":"c107","attributes":{"relationship":"Stewart’s opinion of Muslims was of particular interest to me when reading his work on Jackson.

In his section on Jackson’s work with the Choctaw nation, Stewart mentions the presence of “negroes, who were held as slaves” but provides no additional commentary on the topic.  Later, he cites a story where a missionary women believed she was being held up by “desperados” because the man interacting with her was “coloured”, despite the fact that he was a soldier in the U.S. Army and coming to her aid.  Nothing in his analysis challenges this as a normalized assumption. Perhaps one of the most striking parts of the book in terms of racial constructions, Stewart relates the story of a “standard bearer of a coloured regiment” who, “in the crisis hour of a great battle of our Civil War” spurred on his regiment to advance in battle against the commanding officer’s wishes, ultimately allowing the “coveted position” to be gained.[1] He uses this story to equate the efforts of Jackson as a standard bearer of Presbyterianism despite the resistance by the Church with this type of heroic advancement. Within the story itself are a number of issues raised in attempting to read this for an understanding of Stewart’s racial construction. Firstly, there is no evidence of this story in the historical canon. If this was a story more intimately familiar to Civil War veterans like Stewart, it has potentially not survived to the present day. The alternative is that Stewart constructed this story himself, drawing on broader symbolisms surrounding the war that would be legible to others without necessarily being historically true. In either case, the relative anonymity of the story necessitates taking pause and considering, if this is Stewart’s own construction, how this might affect a reading of the text. Secondly, in either case presented here, Stewart is still creating dialogue for a story that does not survive within the canon at present, suggesting that perhaps he constructed this dialogue himself. Aspects of the dialogue lend support to this reading. While Stewart’s dialogue for the soldier is in keeping with white depictions of Black vernacular and pronunciations in the period (jarring though it may be to read today), he has the solider refer to his commanding officer as “Marse Captain”. While Marse is a construction of “master” that would have been well-known at the time, the specific phrase “Marse Captain” does not appear in any other texts from this period. In consultation with Giuliana Perrone and Dale Kretz, both confirmed that this was something that appears singular to Stewart’s writing. There is no evidence to my or their knowledge suggesting that Black soldiers would have referred to their commanding officers as “Marse” before their rank. With this addressed, a number of questions are then raised—why does Stewart depict freedmen using the language of enslavement with their commanding officers in the Union army? It can be presumed that this man’s commanding officer would have been white (given the structure of these military regiments and further reaffirmed by Stewart’s choice not to use the vernacular constructions of Black language in the quote attributed to the officer in the story). Does Stewart simply believe that the language of enslavement carried through into military service for freedmen? Does he see this figure as being in a position of servitude? What are the implications in how he writes this for his understanding of Black freedom? Thirdly, the very nature of the comparison being made here requires an analysis of its own. In this passage, Stewart is equating the heroic actions of a Black solider in the Civil War to the actions of Jackson in advancing missionary work in the West. The equation of the two is striking—does Stewart believe that this struggle for freedom and the nature of war for Black soldiers was so significant that it needs to be used in this comparison to highlight the importance of Jackson’s advancement? Is the race of the soldier significant to him, or is this a story that’s being used to consider war more broadly as a metaphor for Jackson’s work? In either case, Stewart has made explicit racial construction of his own and paralleled these events, suggesting that there is at least some form of equivalence in his mind that would also be conveyed to his readers. I am trying to keep in mind that for him this is likely an elevation of this freedom struggle in wartime, not a diminishment—however, it is striking to me to see something as serious as the role of Black soldiers in the Civil War being compared to a missionary attempting to further colonize and Christianize the American West. While this passage is very short, it’s incredibly rich, and has given me much to consider moving forward.Another wrinkle in Stewart’s construction of race is his inclusion of a passage from Southern Workman by Francesco Rios that uses the term “Topsy” to describe an Indigenous child brought into the boarding school program. Calling this child “a regular Topsy”, he uses it to define her by her “queer and wild ways”.[2] In Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Topsy is a character who goes from a state of wildness and neglect to a good Christian child through nurture and care (and interestingly, goes to Africa to become a teacher).[3] By including a passage that involves collapsing this Black character with an Indigenous child and not providing any additional critique or nuance, Stewart’s understanding of the motif is complicated. It can be inferred that this would have been a familiar comparison to his audience, perhaps simply a tool to illustrate the impact of Christian education on a child. However, the racial boundaries crossed here are of interest to me. Stewart also may be tipping his hand in the language used for comparison of the groups the Home Board expanded to serve in 1885. He notes that the field of work was enlarged “by the addition of a department of instruction for the benefit of the ignorant masses of the negro race in the South”, while southern mountain people who were also included in this expansion are referred to as “needy whites”.[4] The contrast of ignorant with needy here is striking, especially when he is referring to groups in the same general region whose main discernable difference is race. This could simply be an unfortunate selection of adjectives, but I also want to keep an eye on it regardless. The task of understanding his perspective on Blackness is further complicated, however, by the commentary he provides in the summation of Jackson’s labors near the end of the work. In the final chapter he lists groups still in need, including “…in the Southland a great host in the dark belts among ten million of the Negro race—in some respects the most needy and the most deserving of our sympathy and help of all the exceptional people of the land”.[5] I’m going to need to chew on this further. In what respects do Black Southerners meet these criteria? Why have other exceptional groups not? He continues on to say that they have not yet “been reached and evangelized”.[6] However, in this period there was significant religious work in the South, and throughout the book he referenced the good work of other Protestant missions as being aspirational or helpful to Presbyterian work, leading me to wonder why these other missions would not be sufficient to address these needs. I assume it comes down to the concept of expansion of Presbyterianism, but it is interesting to see the positioning of Black Southerners in this light. While he seems to be acknowledging systemic disadvantages, the tone remains patronizing, perhaps embodying the duality that likely existed in his life.","source":"37","target":"87","id":"c112","attributes":{"relationship":"There are places where Black experiences are mentioned but not explored or elaborated upon.

In the introduction to Sheldon Jackson, Stewart refers to the West as “virgin territory”, and in his discussion of the movement of missionaries into this space states that “there is something incredibly grand in this steady and long-continued march of civilization”.[1] He goes on to write that missionary preachers in the West were at the “outmost verge of civilization” as part of the “great army of occupation”.[2] For the time period this language is unsurprising, but is worth noting here as part of the broader approach Stewart is taking in his construction of the frontier. He even goes as far as to state that part of the Colorado territory was “hitherto regarded as inaccessible and unfit for human abode”, suggesting a break not only in race but humanity with the occupants of the region.[3] Later in the discussion of Jackson’s work in the territory he refers to the area as “where in 1877 the Ute Indians and wild animals had full possession”, further reifying this divide.[4] These sorts of references to an uncivilized wilderness in which Indigenous people do not constitute civilized or fully human actors continue throughout the work. Stewart’s commentary throughout the work furthers this narrative of uncivilization among Indigenous tribes. In the chapter on Jackson’s initial missionary posting in the Choctaw Nation, Stewart states that missionaries like Jackson were sent to “reservations, remote from civilization, and virtually outside its pale”.  The continued representation of Indigenous groups as being removed from any concept of civilization is crystallized here with direct reference to reservations being outside these systems. Stewart goes on to say that the reservation was “more remote from the haunt of civilization, in point of time, than any of our mission fields in Syria or South America at present”, with present being the early 1900s.  In further describing this posting he refers to those members of the tribe that were not yet educated by Christians as “half-tamed”, following this description with accounts of the efforts made to correct for this by Jackson and his wife.  While the overwhelming trend of the work skews towards the aforementioned concepts of Indigeneity, there are a number of places where Stewart’s narrative may demonstrate some nuance in his views. One aspect of language that perhaps suggests a more nuanced approach to the deluge of stereotypes is Stewart’s reference to the Nez Perce revolt. He refers to Chief Joseph’s leadership as “able” and does not further slander his efforts or character.  I don’t know how much this matters at this stage, but I wanted to include it in this analysis for future reference. Additionally, Stewart references an Indigenous teacher and convert to the missionary cause in Alaska, Clah, without overt derision.  He also quotes a newspaper reporter’s account of a meeting that Jackson attended in Washington where the Indigenous men in the room were described as “of great ability and superior culture” without providing any sort of rebuttal or commentary of his own.  Similarly, he discusses briefly Indigenous Rev. Edward Marsden.  Perhaps the movement from heathen to Christian (or participation in American society within the bounds of “Anglo-Saxon” propriety) can do more work here with blurring the lines of race in his assessment. From another perspective, he quotes missionary Mrs. Summers’ comment that Inuit are better than Lapps with the reindeer introduced by Jackson and she would only hire them to work with the reindeer.  While this might initially seem like a form of compliment or acknowledgment of agency, I aim to remain aware of the role that the concept of the natural predisposition of certain groups to forms of service might play in this assessment.","source":"37","target":"83","id":"c108","attributes":{"relationship":"Stewart builds the world of Jackson’s missionary work with language that evokes the common tropes of wilderness and uncivilized frontiers in the American West.

It was the missionary who first washed the filthy… reformed the vicious… taught them the use of the English forms of speech and roused within their beclouded minds the desire and ambition to study and work as well as pray”. Stewart represents missionaries such as Jackson as prime movers in making the population civilized and governable.
